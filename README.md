## Setup Instructions  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/dhirthacker7/r_projects.git  
cd r_projects  
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have R installed. Use the following commands in your R console to install the necessary libraries:
```bash
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "caret", "shiny"))  
```

### 3. Run Projects
Open the R scripts (.R files) or R Markdown (.Rmd) files in your preferred R editor (RStudio) and execute them step-by-step or knit the files for comprehensive reports.
